My First Website without using any resources........
Udemy Clone - Simple Version
This is a simple Udemy clone created as my first web development project using HTML and CSS. The project aims to replicate the basic structure and layout of Udemy, an online learning platform, without advanced functionality.

Features:
Basic layout inspired by the Udemy platform.
Home page with a list of courses (static).
Simple course detail page design.
Responsive design using basic CSS.
Technologies Used:
HTML for the structure of the website.
CSS for styling and layout.
Future Updates:
This project is a starting point and will be further developed to include additional features such as:

Dynamic content rendering.
User authentication and profiles.
Course creation and purchase functionality.
Backend integration (Node.js/Express, or other technologies).
Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest improvements! ðŸš€
